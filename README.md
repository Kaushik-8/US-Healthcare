# 🏥 US Healthcare Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **US healthcare patient data** to uncover insights into:
- Medical conditions and their prevalence
- Distribution of patients by age group, gender, and blood type
- Hospital admissions, billing, medications, and test results
- Trends useful for healthcare management and policy-making

The dataset was visualized into an **interactive dashboard** to support data-driven decision-making in healthcare systems.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains **synthetic patient records** including demographic, medical, and hospital information.

**Key Features:**
- **Demographics:** Name, Age, Age Group, Gender, Blood Type  
- **Medical Info:** Condition, Admission Type, Doctor, Hospital  
- **Treatment:** Medication, Test Results, Discharge Date  
- **Finance:** Billing Amount, Days of Stay, Duration  
- **Derived Fields:** Month, Year, Condition-Intensity combinations

## 📈 Analysis Performed
1. **Patient Demographics**  
   - Distribution by **age groups** (Teenage, Adults, Middle Age, Old Age)  
   - Distribution by **gender** and **blood type**

2. **Medical Conditions**  
   - Prevalence of Hypertension, Cancer, Obesity, Arthritis, Asthma, Diabetes, etc.  
   - Cross-analysis by gender and age group

3. **Hospitalization & Finance**  
   - Admission types (Emergency, Elective, Urgent)  
   - Average billing amount by condition and hospital stay  
   - Days of stay analysis

4. **Outcome Analysis**  
   - Test results distribution (Normal, Abnormal, Inconclusive)  
   - Medications prescribed

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Excel / Power BI** → Data visualization & dashboards  
- **SQL / Python (optional if used)** → Data cleaning & exploration  
- **Numpy/Pandas (optional)** → Data preprocessing  

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- Hypertension, Cancer, and Obesity are the top 3 conditions.  
- Majority of long-duration hospitalizations are linked to **Obesity and Arthritis**.  
- Gender plays a significant role in condition prevalence (e.g., Diabetes more common in females).  
- Blood type distribution is fairly even across the population.  
- Emergency admissions have the **highest billing amounts**.
